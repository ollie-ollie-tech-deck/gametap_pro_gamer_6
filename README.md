# GameTap-Pro-Gamer-6

The source code to GameTap Pro Gamer 6, a Sonic hack dedicated to Clownancy, as an ode to old ROM hacks and pop culture in the 2000s. 

I released this back in 2019 on SSRG. Unfortunately, the community didn't take it very seriously, and Clownancy was weirded out by it. I don't know why, but maybe it's because they couldn't comprehend my art. I'm sorry that it wasn't as good as it could have been, but I tried my best. The sequel, [GameTap, Cup Noodles, and Bitter Tears](https://github.com/ollie-ollie-tech-deck/gametap_32x), surpasses this by a longshot, anyways, so go check that out.

I do want to shout out Clownancy, once more, for using this hack to fix a sprite rendering bug in their emulator, [clownmdemu](https://github.com/Clownacy/clownmdemu). For that, I am grateful.
